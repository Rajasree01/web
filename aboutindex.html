    <div class="mn">
        <p>The <b>KVASU</b>came into existence on <b>14th June, 2010,</b> as per Ordinance number 44/2010 and later Act 3/2011 of the Government of Kerala.
            The University hence is the product of continuous and genuine pursuit and sustained dream of many a people, who initiated the efforts since the mid-nineties.
             The establishment is also the result of the recognition of the need to advance animal production sector activities and to widen the arena of academic opportunities, 
             applied research and entrepreneurship in the field of animal health, production and allied subjects.
    
        The University is a public funded University with headquarters at Pookode, Wayanad, and the powers of the University are vested in its authorities â€“the Management Council and the Board of Management.
